# Inheritenance, ES5

* JS has one construct: objects
* Each object has a private property - [[Prototype]] (holds a link to another object called its prototype)
* That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype (end of the chain)

# Object.create
* creates a new object 
* prototype of this object is the first argument of the function

```javascript
let a = {a: 1}; 
```
 a ---> Object.prototype ---> null
```javascript
let b = Object.create(a);
console.log(b.a); // 1 (inherited)
```
 b ---> a ---> Object.prototype ---> null

```javascript
let c = Object.create(b);
console.log(c.a); // 1 (inherited)
```
 c ---> b ---> a ---> Object.prototype ---> null


```javascript
let d = Object.create(null);
console.log(d.hasOwnProperty); 
```
 d ---> null
 undefined, because d doesn't inherit from Object.prototype




# ES5 Inheritenance
```javascript
function Person(name, born){
    this.name = name;
    this.born = born;
}

Person.prototype.age = function(){
    console.log(2017 - this.born);
}

var me = new Person("Filip", 1999);
me.age();

var terka = Object.create(me);
terka.name = "Terka";
terka.born = 2000;
terka.age();
```
