# Promises

* = proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created
* asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future
* first appearance 2007 ->  MochiKit, jQuery

## States
* pending: initial value
* fullfilled: success
* rejected: fail
* when either of those options happen, the associated handlers queued up by promise`s "then" method is called

## ex. 1

```javascript 
function timeout(duration) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(resolve, duration);
    });
}

const m = timeout(5000).then(() => {
    console.log("done!");
});
```
## ex. 2
### Promise.reject
* returns a P object, that is rejected with a given reason

### Promise.resolve
* returns a P object, that is rejected witha given value

```javascript
let P = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    
    let isClean = true;
    
    if (isClean){
        resolve("CLEAN!");
    } else {
        reject("NOT CLEAN!");
    }
});
    
P.then(fromResolve => {
    console.log(`The room is ${fromResolve}`);
}).catch(fromReject => {
    console.log(`The room is ${fromReject}`);
});
    
//-> The room is CLEAN!
   ``` 
## ex. 3
### Promise.all
* Returns a P that either fulfills when ALL of the P in the iterable argument have f. or r. as soon as one of the P in the iterable argument rejects
### Promise.race
* Returns a P that fulfills or rejects as soon as ONE of the P in the iterable f. or r., with the value/reason from that P
```javascript
let clean = (message) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve("Cleaned the room.");  
});
    
 
let win = (message) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve(`${message} Won an IceCream.`);  
});
    
 clean()
     .then(res => win(res))
     .then(res => {
        console.log(`Finished. (${res})`);
    });
  
//-> Finished. (Cleaned the room. Won an IceCream.)

Promise.all([clean(), win()]).then(() => {
    console.log("All are finished.");
});
//.race -> One of them is finished

```

# Modules

```javascript

//utility.js
function generateRandom() {
    return Math.random();
}

function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

export { generateRandom, sum }

//app.js
import { generateRandom, sum } from 'utility';

console.log(generateRandom()); //logs a random number
console.log(sum(1, 2)); //3
// var utils = {}   export default utils;
