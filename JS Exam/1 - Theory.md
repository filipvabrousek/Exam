 ### How they work
 1) client send http(s) request to some adress (GET request) - it can deny / accept
 2) layout engine renders received markup into website
 POST request: send message, etc..  
 PUT request: change user name, ..etc  
 prefix of the URL defines how the page will be interpreted (mailto launches client)
 
 
 
 ## JS Engines
program or interpreter which executes JS code
* 2008 - 2009 JS Engine war
* 2010 - JS Engine race (Opera, Firefox, Safari, IE 9)
* V8, Spidermonkey (1st)...
